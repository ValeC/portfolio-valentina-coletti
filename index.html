It a unique fintech solution that uses AI and an ordinary webcam or smartphone to capture facial expressions in real-time as users watch a video about a variety of financial issues.

                              <p>
                                Insights ADVISOR, previously named EmotionAdvisor, was a Flash-based web application composed of one element called “Experience”. The users could answer a few simple questions about themselves and their priorities and watch a short video while the system captured their facial expressions. At the end the system created their personalized report, which they could either keep to themselves, or share with their advisor.<br>
                                The objective of NVISO was to take EmotionAdvisor to the next level by providing a more complete fintech solution where companies could manage the data collected from their clients and generate leads. A client (an American company of financial advisors) was interested in investing time, budget and their expertise to develop the product with NVISO.

                              <h5>MY ROLE</h5>
                              <p>
                                I was hired to help NVISO conceive the user experience of the new version of EmotionAdvisor and to manage the project, including interaction with all stakeholders (target users, client, developers, marketing team, graphic designer and so on).

                              <br>
                              <h5>THE TEAM</h5>
                              <p>
                                The project team varied over time but on average it was composed of a graphic designer, eight developers, one QA, three marketing, a technical project manager and myself. Most of the team was working remotely. I was the only one responsible for the UX aspect. Only few people knew a little what UX design is about.

                              <h5>THE APPROACH</h5>
                              <p>
                                To accomplish my tasks, I put in place the User-Centered Design (UCD) process in Scrum methodology with the help of JIRA management tool.

                              <h6>User Research</h6>
                              <p>
                                I began the project when the clients and NVISO had already some ideas on the needs and features the new version of EmotionAdvisor had to have. The first phase was mainly discussions with client and some target users about the features to add. We had multiple conference calls and whiteboarding sessions.<br>
                                Final target users were clients (investors), financial advisors and the financial companies (such as banks, financial advisor groups, insurances and so on).
                                <br>
                                After going through all of their feature requests, we were able to identify their most important needs and could finally define the use cases, scenarios and user flows which were used as the reference to focus and develop features.

                              <p>
                                From the previous findings I began to create wireframes and prototypes with MS Visio, Sketch, Adobe Suite, InVision and proto.io. As I was constantly in contact with each stakeholder, I was able to create a proposal that considered each aspect: business requirements, as well astechnical feasibility and limitations. The wireframes/prototypes were the visual basics where we could begin the discussion and that made sure that each stakeholder was on the same line.

                              <p>
                                I organized multiple user evaluation sessions in different ways such as remotely, in a bank and in the office. The user flows were tested by the target users with clickable prototypes created in proto.io.
                                <br><br>
                                Here a small example:
                                <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                                  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="img/works/nviso/nvisoEvaluation.mp4" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                </div>

                                <p>
                                They accomplished tasks while think-aloud and at the end I asked questions. In this way, I could collect feedbacks which were a precious resource that helped me to improve the prototype for the next iteration.

                              <p>
                                Each time a prototype was agreed, I had contact with the graphic designer who created a pixel perfect PSD file (Photoshop). The latter was part of the package that was transmitted to the developers along with the specifications of it. Before they began to develop, I made them a presentation of the whole piece of system that they were about to develop to make sure they understood what was required. Then, during the development, I was in regular contact with them to answer questions and make a clear and neat description before they dived into the details.

                                EmotionAdvisor upper version is now called <a href ="https://insightsadvisedemo.nviso.ai">Insights ADVISE</a>. It has additional components other than the initial “Experience”: Dashboards, Landing Page, iOS app, Email and multiple Reports. It is currently ready to be deployed and used by the members of the American company that invested in its development.

                                <b class="lessless">Raise awareness about UX.</b><br>
                                In this project, a big challenge for me was to be sure that UX design was considered and accepted by the other members of the team as they had never had occasion to include it in their projects in the past. They cared about the project as much as I did and they wanted to be convinced about what everybody’s efforts actually contributed to the product. It took some months of concrete examples to convince the team about the positive impact of UX. This motivated me to make more efforts, to be humble and confident. Furthermore, it was a good exercise before pitching to the other stakeholders such as the client, sometimes not convinced about proposals that were different from what they expected. Thanks to the concrete arguments found from users’ feedbacks, we could easily find a solution that fitted for all parties.

                                <b class="lessless">Importance of visual support.</b><br>
                                One key learning is always using visual representation of what I am talking about. only in this way could the discussion with multiple people (meaning different personalities, point of views, brains, experiences, roles,…) be efficient and productive.

                                 Working for NVISO allowed me to develop some skills that are related to my personality and my work attitude. In fact, thanks to my social and communicative nature and to my technical knowledge, I could efficiently collaborate with people that have different job positions than mine such as developers, graphic designers, QA, marketing, and also with clients with whom I also practiced presenting and defending my proposals.

                                 With NVISO I had also the great opportunity to go to Dubai (United Arab Emirates) where I could help the marketing team develop the business in the Middle East, while at the same time keep on developing Insights ADVISE.

                        <h5>THE COMPANY</h5>
                          <p>
                            <a href ="http://www.hydros.ch">Hydros Innovation</a> is a company based at the EPFL Innovation Park of Lausanne (Switzerland) specialized in the energy efficiency of ships. Its team of engineers and mathematicians developed a software in C++, a boat simulator (please have a look   <a href ="http://www.hydros.ch/en/hydros-innovation/expertise/item/static-and-dynamic-simulation.html">here</a> and <a href ="http://www.hydros.ch/en/hydros-innovation/expertise/item/software-design.html">here</a>), that helped them save time in design quality. Thanks to this expertise, Hydros has been present at the America's Cup since 2011.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <h5>THE OBJECTIVE</h5>
                          <p>
                            The boat simulator had already a user interface but there were usability problems. A clear example was the fact that when naval architects or engineers had simply to modify a parameter of the boat (i.e. the sail height), they needed to open a very long XML file, find the tag representing the right parameter, modify it, save the file and recompile it.
                            </p>
                            <div class="row">
                              <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12">
                                <img src="img/works/hydros/hydros2.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive center">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                            This was clearly feasible if they were dealing with one or two modifications of a simple boat, but when it was a matter of more modifications and of a complex boat, which was the most common case, it was easily causing mistakes and big waste of time.
                            <br>
                            Then, the more the software evolved, the more functionalities were added and the existing one were improved.
                            Another issue was that the boat simulator interface was written in a complicated development library (WxWidget) with little documentation and poorly maintained.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <h5>MY ROLE</h5>
                          <p>
                            I was hired to redesign the boat simulator user interface in terms of UX to help the users to use it in a performant and quick way. In addition, my task was also to change its development library (Qt).
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <h5>THE TEAM</h5>
                          <p>
                            The Boat Design Team was composed by naval engineers, naval architects and mathematicians with programming skills. One person was responsible for the implementation of the boat simulator and I was the only one responsible for the UX aspect. The team had a vague idea about UX design. We were working in an open space office.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <h5>THE APPROACH</h5>
                          <p>
                            To accomplish my tasks, I put in place the User-Centered Design (UCD) process in Scrum methodology to be focused on creating an MVP that met the user’s core need. In fact, I created 2-weeks sprints that covered the whole project (with plenty of post-it, yeah!). But before all, I introduced UX Design to my colleagues to raise their awareness of it. This created a very constructive mindset for the positive achievement of the project.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <h6>User Research</h6>
                          <p>
                            I began to know the users and their needs by using methods such as individual interviews, focus group and observation. As the final users were literally my “deskmate”, I fortunately had easy access to their daily work. In fact, I observed and followed physically the design process from the start to the end. This allowed me to understand the users, their needs and problems. Then, throughout the project, I organized iterative focus group and individual interviews to clear doubts and go into details.
                            The target users were senior, junior and apprentice naval engineers and architects.
                            <br>
                            To identify what we needed to accomplish, we started out by assembling a focus group of the target users. After going through all of their feature requests, we were able to identify their most important needs and key pain points.
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <h6>Prototyping</h6>
                          <p>
                            From the key specifications that had to be included, we began to map out the user flows during participatory design with plenty of sketches in paper and pen. Then, we identified the most relevant features that had to be of immediate access. This allowed me to begin to propose the first wireframes in Balsamiq.
                            <br><br>
                            Here some examples:
                            <div class="container">
                                <div class="row">
                                  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-7">
                                    <img src="img/works/hydros/hydros3.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
                                  </div>
                                </div>
                                <div class="row">
                                  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-7">
                                    <img src="img/works/hydros/hydros4.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
                                  </div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                          </p>
                          <br>
                          <h6>User Evaluations</h6>
                          <p>
                            To realize more concretely whether the workflow of the features in the wireframes were usable for the target users, I created several clickable prototypes. Those where used during user evaluation sessions where the user had to accomplish some tasks and think-aloud while performing them. In the meanwhile, I was there to observe the interaction between the user and the system. I made sure that the user understood that I wasn’t there to judge him/her but the system. After each session, I had the possibility to interview the users and collect feedbacks to improve further the wireframe. As the company was periodically hiring apprentices and they were using the boat simulator for their project in the company, I had constant feedback from multiple people that didn’t develop the software. This was also a precious resource for me from a fresh mind.
                            <br><br>
                            Here a small example:
                            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                              <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="img/works/hydros/hydrosEvaluation.mp4" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            </div>
                          <br>
                          <h6>Development and final product</h6>
                          <p>
                            As I was working as UX designer and software developer in an agile way, I made sure that for each sprint, except the user research period at the beginning, some features were prototyped, tested and implemented.
                            <br>
                            In this project I didn’t need a graphic designer as Qt library already provided a standard design.
                            <br><br>
                            Here some screenshots of the final product:

                          <p>
                            The new user interface was well received within the company; it helped target users to work more efficiently and with less frustration. Furthermore, the simulator developed by Hydros has been chosen for the dynamic simulation and the performance prediction of the Italian flying catamarans (Luna Rossa) of the 35th America's Cup in 2017.

                            <b class="lessless">Responsability - Proactiveness - Organisazion.</b><br>
                            This was my first professional project, during the end and right after my Master degree. I realized that this was a great opportunity to begin with a project where I had two caps - UX designer and software engineer – I was the only responsible for both aspects.
                            <br>
                            Moreover, I had the target users next to my office chair, which is not a usual scenario. These conditions helped me to quickly take responsibility, be proactive and organized, efficiently observe target users and have a flexible mindset to learn a discipline that is completely different from mine. Skills that I perpetually and happily still use in my career.

                            I had the chance to discover the calm and nature with a sailing boat in the middle of the Geneva Lake and Mediterranean sea. This contributed to make this experience amazing!

                              <p>
                                <a href ="https://coteries.com/">Coteries</a> is a digital agency providing web and native mobile application (iOS, Android, Windows) development services, as well as UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) services and digital marketing services. It is based at the EPFL Innovation Park of Lausanne (Switzerland).
                                One of the applications developed is <a href ="https://planify.io/">Planify.io</a>, a group travel planning solution, allowing tour organizers to save time while designing attractive and complex itineraries.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>THE OBJECTIVE</h5>
                              <p>
                                Coteries wanted to build a new and easier way to organize and plan group trips avoiding the hassle of numerous email and calls exchanges and overwhelming amounts of papers. The idea was to have a web manager where the organizer would design and fill the itinerary in a structured way and also invite contributors to collectively edit the plan.<br>
                                Then, the organizer should be able to easily share the travel itinerary with the participants in multiple ways (Planify mobile application, PDF or paper brochure). Furthermore, the travel itinerary would be always up-to-date, with all content automatically updated in the mobile app.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>MY ROLE</h5>
                              <p>
                                I was hired to create the user experience of Planify, especially for the web manager.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>THE TEAM</h5>
                              <p>
                                The team was composed of two developers, two graphic designers, one person from the marketing department and myself for UX. The team had a good idea about UX design. We were working in an open space office.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>THE APPROACH</h5>
                              <p>
                                I used User-Centered Design (UCD) process to develop the user experience and we integrated it in sprints (Scrum) during which we created MVP.

                              <h6>User Research</h6>
                              <p>
                                When I began the project, Coteries had already done some research regarding the target users and their needs for the web manager. They were organizers of tours (holidays, business trips, student trips, private trips, …) or of events (conferences, regattas, workshops, concerts…).
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h6>Prototyping</h6>
                              <p>
                                A few focus groups were organized where were invited professional organizers that helped me create wireframes. They also confirmed and developed the needs we had found in the previous phase. We had whiteboards, post-its and pens that helped us to explore together the ideas which I translated in Sketch and proto.io and reworked again with the target users.
                                <br><br>
                                Here an example:
                                <br>
                                <div class="container">
                                    <div class="row">
                                      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-7">
                                        <img src="img/works/coteries/coteries2.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
                                      </div>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h6>User Evaluations</h6>
                              <p>
                                From the wireframes, I created clickable prototypes intended for usability tests. As there was little time to iterate the prototypes many times and as the users could have been anyone that would like to organize a trip, I asked random people near our office to spend just ten minutes to test the new web application imagining that they would create a private trip or a conference or a business trip. With just a few testers, I could quickly identify the major usability issues and correct them. In this way, we had the possibility to advance on our sprints of only two weeks.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h6>Development and final product</h6>
                              <p>
                                Within the team, there was a good communication and organization on the things to do as we were just a few people and were located in the same office. This was very helpful, and we could reach a first version of the product efficiently. Other than the web manager, Planify is also available as a mobile application (for the participants of the trip). The latter was developed in parallel to the web manager, which allowed the user experience to be thought in a complete/holistic way.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h5>OUTCOME</h5>
                              <p>
                                First version of Planify was successfully tested with Coterie’s biggest customer, that was planning a “Top Executives Learning Tour” to Silicon Valley.

                                <b class="lessless">Focus on priorities.</b><br>
                                While creating Planify, we easily fell into the temptation to go too far with our fantasy. As this project was short on time, I couldn’t make long sessions of prototyping and usability tests with users to test all our ideas. Thus, I learned to go straight to the point, meaning to focus on the priorities and on our principal objectives.
                                <br><br>
                                <b class="lessless">Few people for biggest usability issues.</b><br>
                                I realized that when you don’t have too much time and little target users at your disposal, only 3-4 people can be enough to spot the biggest usability problems on the prototype.
